## Started practcing the C sharp as part of the Azure developer course at Jensen YH
### Exploring the Markdown elements
**Me Gouthami started liking the C sharp**
*I wish I had tried this earlier*
> I am exploring the bitwise operators which I never had a chance to use in other programming languages. I recalled Alan Turning what he had done with his Enigma during this stint
1. C sharp looks easy looking forward to explore how it is being consumed by the institutions
2. It is fun to play around git with these markdown elements
3. I write you read
- Microsoft is making my coding life much easier
- It was amazing to explore the self leadership content offered by Jenses YH
- Looking forward to meet other explorers tomorrow
